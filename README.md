# JETSON IP RETRIEVE
The idea is to be able to fetch my jetson nano's ip address in order to connect via ssh or vnc. This scripts are supossed fetch and forward the IP address from the jetson nano to my pc through a third party server running node red. This way the address is obtained without arising suspicions by performing an intrusive scan in a whole network segment of the university's network. This would most likely be spotted by a firewall.
